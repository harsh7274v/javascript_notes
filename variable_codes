how to use a variable in our javascript program

  in javascript we always end every programming line with this ;

  we use var and let to declare a variable. 
  if we use var to declare a variable then in case of var we can first initialise the variable then we can declare the var bbut in case of let we can't do like this.

    var myAge=21;
    var myAge=15;
    we can declare and initialise like this in var but in let we can't be able to do like var.

      in numbers----- let my_numbers=17;
      in strings ------ let hero="i'm";
      in boolean --------  let imalive=true; or let  test=6<3;
      it return false;


      arrays=======

      let run=["train","bike","scooter"];
      let number=["15","45","56"];
after this u can call like this
      number[0];

      objects========
      let imHaving={name:"harsh",class:"btech"};
        call
        imHaving.name;

dynamic typing
        
        let myNumber = "500"; // oops, this is still a string
typeof myNumber;
myNumber = 500; // much better â€” now this is a number
typeof myNumber;


        Constants in JavaScript---------------
As well as variables, you can declare constants. These are like variables, except that:

you must initialize them when you declare them
you can't assign them a new value after you've initialized them.

  Similarly, with let you can initialize a variable, and then assign it a new value (this is also called reassigning the variable):


let count = 1;
count = 2;

        
If you try to do this using const you will see an error:


const count = 1;
count = 2;


  bird.species = "Striated Caracara";
console.log(bird.species); // "Striated Caracara"



  Use const when you can, and use let when you have to.

This means that if you can initialize a variable when you declare it, and don't need to reassign it later, make it a constant.
